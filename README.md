Clean and recoded dataset, as well as the codebook is available on SwitchDrive - 05-Mediat Outlets > 01- Analysis.




Recoding and cleaning of the code:
If you work with raw data,  follow these instructions:

In this project, we conceived the code in modules.

Always use Main.R when you want to run the code. 
If you want to check the actual module code, alter it or add new functions to it, then go to the specific module file and work in there.

Main.R will call the modules and execute the code in them.
