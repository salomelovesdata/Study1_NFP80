# Study1_NFP80
Code for study 1

In this project, we conceived the code in modules.

Always use Main.R when you want to run the code. 
If you want to check the actual module code, alter it or add new additions to it, then go to the specific module file and work in there.

Main.R will call the modules and execute the code in them.
